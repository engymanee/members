Javascript using Node js.
Mongo DB

## Your Task

In this project, you will develop an exclusive blog where only members who are signed in can post messages. Only members can view authors, post stories, and comment. Non-members can only view the posts.

Users should be able to log in using a username and password. You will need to log user messages with a time stamp and text. The database should be used to keep track of this information.

Feel free to tweak the design as you want, and pick your fonts, colours, styles, etc.

## Steps
Design the Database model.
Setup your database on Mongo
Create a login form using Javascript
All messages should be displayed on the homepage, but only members can ‘create a new message.’
All messages should be displayed, but only members can “view authors.”

## Starter Code
We suggest you follow these steps to generate a skeleton website. 

## Testing
Test your application using Heroku

## Expected Results
The output of your webpage could look like this.



## Hints
You should validate the parameters on the signup form. Ideas on how to do that here.


## Bonus Task
Include an admin user who can delete messages.
